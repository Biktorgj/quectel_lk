# Little Kernel bootloader for Pinephone's Modem

The Pinephone uses the Quectel EG25G Modem.
This repository contains the Little Kernel Bootloader modified to be able to boot it.
If you want to build it yourself, you will _also need_ to sign it using Qualcomm's Test Keys using SecTools. For copyright reasons I can't include them here, but they are available in some other repositories.
